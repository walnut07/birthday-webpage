## What did I learned thuoghout building the page?
ðŸ“š I was totally a beginner of HTML & CSS when started this project. <br> 
However, I learned HTML & CSS on freeCodeCamp and did three mock-up projects by myself and then I started to work on it. <br>
It took approximately two weeks to finish it.

## Reflection
ðŸ’» I should've used grid insted of flex in the message section. I could've used grid if I had designed the page in more detail in a prototyping tool.<br>
ðŸŽ¨ Realized the significance of color theories! I asked for some advice to one of my friends who goes to an art college. She gave me such an insightful message based on color theory.
